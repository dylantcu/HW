Program 1 only takes a text file array and analyzes the data to output a visual representation of an electron microscope image.

Program 2 attempts to find the roots of a quadratic equation, but fails when given any sort of small number as an input.

Program 3 takes a function and integrates it, outputs a graph of heat capacity vs temperature.

Program 4 integrates a function and graphs it as well. This function has no analytic solution. Go figure. 



Solutions to program 2:
"""
solutions: -9.99989424599e-07,-999999.999999
'alternative' solutions: -1000010.57551,-1e-06

because b**2 and 4ac have such drstic differences, the error takes hold and 
really messes things up.

### I have no idea how i'm supposed to accurately calculate this.

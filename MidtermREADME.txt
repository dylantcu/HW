Part b)
	The total distance travelled before the projectile hits the ground is 933.82 meters in the case of air resistance and a lead ball. The total distance in the case of 0 air resistance is 998.85 meters. The plots show the difference between the two trajectories. 

Part c)
	The total distance travelled before the projectile (Ag and Pu respectively) hits the ground is (929.29, 960.14). The total distance without air resistance is (998.85,998.85) meters, which is uncoincidentally the same exact (to 9 decimal places) value measured in part b. This brings us to why the density produces different results with air resistance. One way to think about it is that (since what’s really changing is mass; volume stays the same) these projectiles all have the same original velocity but different masses. Thus, more dense projectiles will have more momentum and it will take more air resistance to counteract that extra momentum. Therefore the heavier balls’ horizontal distance is reduced at a disproportionate rate to lighter balls’.

	I attached more plots than you asked for I think, so hopefully the data backs up what I’ve said above. I hope I have answered these questions thoroughly. The legend did not show up for the density comparison graph in the output (and I accidentally deleted that block of code) so just know the blue line is Pu, the red is Pb, the green is Ag.

1 a) 
	Simply (integer) divide the number by 2, then store the remainder in the 
	ones place of the binary output. Then keep dividing by 2, always storing the 
	remainder in the next highest place. Stop when your number can be divided no 
	more (when the number is 0). Use the first digit of the binary number as the 
	sign for the number, 0 is positive, 1 is negative.

2 a)
	The speed at which an orbiting mass travels is 
		v = (GM/r)^(1/2)
	where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the earth, and 
	r is the radius from the center of gravity of the earth.
		v^2 = GM/r
		d^2/t^2 = GM/r
		4pi^2r^2/t^2 = GM/r
		4pi^2r^3/t^2 = GM
		r^3 = GMt^2/4pi^2
		r = (GMt^2/4pi^2)^(1/3)
	Since r is the distance from the center of gravity, we can rewrite it as
		r = R + h
	where R and h are the radius of the earth and the height above that
	respectively. Thus
		h = (GMt^2/4pi^2)^(1/3) - R

  c) 1 day orbit height: 35855.9 km
     90 minute orbit height: 279.3 km
     45 minute orbit height: -2181.6 km
	a 45 minute orbit is not possible

  d) Persidereal day orbit height: 35773.8 km
	this is an 82 km difference in height from a 24 hour day.
	the figure 24 hours is derived from our relation to the sun, from my
	understanding, the earth actually rotates a little bit faster. This 
	distinction is made because the earth is not just rotating, but is also
	revolving around the sun, bringing the sunrise later than if we just take
	earth’s rotation into account.

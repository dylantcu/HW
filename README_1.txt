The first program (problem 1) asks for an input of an integer, checks if negative, and then outputs the binary representation of this number (larger integers produce incorrect results as a result of memory error)

The second program (problem 2) asks for an input of a period for a satellite around earth. The program outputs how far you would have to launch the satellite.
